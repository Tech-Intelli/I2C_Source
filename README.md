ExplAIstic is an image captioning and image hashtagging application that generates nicely written captions and adds related hashtags to your images. It utilizes pre-trained Imagenet models and ChatGPT for the image analysis and caption generation, and the Telegram API for the messaging feature.

## Installation üöÄ

To use the application, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or later
- PyTorch
- transformers
- NumPy
- Flask
- python-telegram-bot

You can install all of these dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project directory.

Note: depending on your system configuration, you might need to manually install the PyTorch and transformers packages with a specific version, such as `torch==1.9.0` and `transformers==4.9.1`.

## Usage üïπÔ∏è

To use the application, you need to get the Telegram bot token by creating a bot on Telegram's BotFather. Then, you can run the following command from the project directory to start the Flask app:

Once the Flask app is running, you can send an image to the Telegram bot, and it will automatically generate a caption and related hashtags for the image.
